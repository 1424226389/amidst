Getting Involved
================

We appreciate more users to help developing Amidst. However, [please get in contact](https://github.com/toolbox4minecraft/amidst/issues/new), BEFORE you make changes. This enables us to discuss and agree on the changes. When you start making changes, please do it in a separate branch and create a pull request from it. Travis CI will tell you, whether your changes pass the build process.
